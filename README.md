# Quantum Algorithms In Action

This repository contains practical implementations of quantum algorithms presented in the paper [_Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03719). The goal of this project is to make foundational quantum algorithms more accessible to learners and developers by providing clear, well-documented code examples.

## ðŸ“˜ Algorithms Included

- **Deutschâ€“Jozsa Algorithm**  
- **Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani Algorithm**  
- **Simonâ€™s Algorithm**  
- **Groverâ€™s Search Algorithm**  
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**  
- **Shorâ€™s Algorithm** (outline)

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Help beginners understand the logic behind quantum algorithms  
- Offer clean and easy-to-follow implementations using Python and Qiskit  
- Serve as a learning companion to the concepts discussed in the paper

## ðŸ”§ Framework

Built with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) â€” IBMâ€™s open-source quantum computing SDK.
